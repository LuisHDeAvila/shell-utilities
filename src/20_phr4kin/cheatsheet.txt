Introduction
The Burnside TX series fixed cellular terminals provide professional telephony features within a
compact and easy-to-use package.
All models can be used with a standard desk phone (or cordless phone) in locations where wired
sockets are not available. The TX2L is fitted with both a PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network)
landline socket as well as a mobile connection.
Both versions are feature rich and can be configured for a variety of applications.
The TX2 can:
 Be configured to report an exceptional event such as power failure.
 Operate from an internal battery in the event of power failure.
 Support many user programmable features.
 Operate as SMS gateway when connected to a PC.
 Provide outgoing call progress announcements.
The TX2L can also:
 Automatically provide backup for landlines in the event of a land line failure.
 Automatically route outgoing calls destined for mobile numbers via the mobile network.
 Forward incoming PSTN calls to a pre-programmed number.
 Provide user recordable announcement to incoming callers on PSTN.
 Allow caller selection of destination department (Auto-Attendant).
The TX2LR can also:
 Pass a landline connection directly through to the telephone when the terminal is off.

Getting started
Remove the clip-on lid to expose the SIM holder and insert a standard size SIM card.
Connect the battery and replace the lid. Connect the antenna, telephone and landline where
appropriate. See the supplied quick start guide for illustrations.
Connect the supplied charger. When charge power is connected for the first time after connecting
the battery, the battery circuit will be conditioned which will take a few seconds. The charge LED will
flash to indicate when the terminal has entered normal charge mode. See the section on LEDs.
The terminal will now be in “charge only mode” and will not be connected to the mobile network. If
the terminal is a TX2LR model, the landline will be connected through to the phone connection.
Turn on the terminal by pressing and holding the red button on the rear of the terminal, when the left
two LEDS light, release the button and the terminal will operate. It will take a few seconds to register
with the mobile network. Now the terminal is ready to make or receive calls.
To test the connection of the connected phone, try a ringback test by dialling *9# and hang up. The
phone should ring.
To test the landline on the TX2L/TX2LR, with the handset off-hook, press the recall button on the
phone and the landline will be connected.
LEDs
There are three LEDs on the terminal. The right hand green LED indicates the state of charging
which applies whether the terminal is in “charge only” mode or when it is operating.
The middle green LED indicates the mode of operation. The left orange LED indicates if the terminal
requires attention.
The table below shows the state and timings of the 3 LEDs. The solid graphic block character ■
represents the LED on, the □ represents the LED off. The ratios illustrated are approximate.

Making and receiving calls
To make a call, lift the handset of the connected telephone and dial the desired number. The call will
be made automatically. With the TX2LR model in the default setting, the call will be routed to either
the landline or the mobile network depending on the number dialled. When dialling a number, the
terminal will wait for 3 seconds after the last digit dialled before trying to connect the number. This
delay can be changed using CFG3. However pressing the # key at the end of the number will cause
the terminal to connect immediately.
To override the automatic line selection on an individual call, dial the prefix *9 before the number you
wish to dial and the call will be routed via the mobile network. To manually select the PSTN, press
the recall or flash-hook.
To make a call on the mobile network optimised for Text Telephone (TTY), dial the prefix *9*1.
This will invoke the Cellular Text Telephone Modem built into the terminal. See CFG40 for more
information.
Emergency calls via the mobile network
Even if there is no signal on the network assigned to the installed SIM, it may still be possible to
make emergency calls provided there is sufficient signal coverage of another network. Simply dial
the 112 international emergency number or the country specific emergency number specified by your
SIM (e.g. 999 in the UK).
Security features
These commands relate to the security access features of the SIM card and network services.
Commands may be entered by dialling on the connected phone or entering “ATD” followed by the
command using the USB.
• Unlock PIN1 *8*[PIN1]#
• Disable PIN1 lock1 *870*[PIN1]#
• Enable PIN1 lock *871*[PIN1]#
• Change PIN1 **04[old PIN]*[new PIN]*[new PIN]#
• Change PIN2 **042*[old PIN2]*[new PIN2]*[new PIN2]#
• Unblock PIN1 **05*[PUK]*[new PIN1]*[new PIN1]#
• Unblock PIN2 **052*[PUK]*[newPIN2]*[newPIN2]#
Notes:
1 Some SIM cards will not allow you to disable PIN1 protection.
2 The PUK (Personal UnblocKing code) is provided by the service provider.

Special mobile call features.
The terminal supports special network call features such as multiparty calling.
Special call features require the use of the button on the attached phone which is
commonly labelled RECALL or R.
Call waiting
Providing call waiting is enabled and supported by your network, an incoming call whilst the
phone is in use will sound a tone in the handset. You have the following options:
Call waiting options
• To ignore the call, wait until the caller either hangs up or is diverted.
• To reject the waiting call and continue with the active call, press R0.
• To end the active call and accept the waiting call, press R1.
• To put the active call on hold and accept the waiting call, press R2.
• To swap between the held call and the active call, press R2 again.
In-call dialling
To make another call while one call is already active.
• Press the R key and dial the number. The active call will be put on hold.
• To swap between the held call and the active call press R2.
Conference calls
To have a conversation with two or more parties.
• Dial the first person in the normal way.
• Press R and then dial the next person.
• Press R3 to create a conference call.
• To add another person, press R and dial the next number. When the person answers, press
R3 to join them to the conference.
If the call is answered by voice mail or the wrong person, press R1 to reject and return to the
conference.
To end the conference call, hang up the telephone.
• To remove one person from the conference, press R1x (where x is the number of the person
in the order the call was set up).
• To have a private conversation with one member of the conference, press R2x (where x is
the number of the person in the order the call was set up). The other parties will be placed on
hold. To return to the conference, press R3.
• To transfer the call to the other parties and end your call, press R4.
Notes:
• The availability of these facilities are dependent on the SIM card and service provider.
• If you try to add a party to a conference call and the call is answered by voice mail, you
should disconnect that party otherwise the conference may be recorded to voice mail until it
becomes full.
• Replacing the handset phone will terminate all calls (held, calling, active or waiting).
• If there is an incoming call while the phone is in use but no call is active, a ringing tone will be
heard through the handset. When the handset is replaced, the phone will ring and the call may
be answered in the normal way.

Call forwarding of incoming mobile calls
Call forwarding is a mobile network service which allows incoming calls to be routed in the network to
an alternative number (such as a voicemail box) when certain criteria are met.
In concert with your service provider, the terminal allows you to control various aspects of the call
forwarding service. The various forwarding criteria are not mutually exclusive and can be used in
combination to divert different types of call to separate numbers.
These commands may be entered by dialling on the connected phone or entering “ATD” followed by
the command using the USB.
Call forwarding commands are composed as follows:
(Command prefix)[Action]*<Phone number>*<Service>#
Command prefixes:
Activate
Register and activate
Deactivate
Unregister and deactivate
Check status (interrogate)¹
*
**
#
##
*#
¹ Interrogation is only possible via USB connection.
[ACTION] criteria:
Forward unconditionally
Forward when busy
Forward when no reply
Forward when signal lost
Forward all calls
Forward all conditional types

Configuration of the terminal
The terminal may be configured using dial codes, commands entered via SMS or the USB interface.
Most commands entered via the USB are also accepted when the terminal is in Charge Only mode.
Some commands are only available via SMS and some SMS commands have both a configuration
code version and a more easy to remember text version.
See the “TX2_CommandsAndConfigCodesV_1_0” document for a convenient overview of the
options and codes.
Commands by DTMF codes (entered on phone)
The command is prefixed with *8 then the command number then * followed by the parameter or
value then terminated by #
Example 1: *83*2# - sets the configuration register 3 with the value 2.
Example 2: *83*2#*84*1# - sets the configuration register 3 with the value 2 and register 4 with 1.
If a command is successful, two beeps are sounded on the handset. If there is an error, one long
beep is sounded. If there is an error, re-enter the correct code.
Command syntax for SMS or via USB
Command type:
Execute: cmd Executes the command. This manual shows no parameters for those.
Read : cmd? Returns the currently set value. This manual shows (?) or (?/=)
Write: cmd=<...> Sets user-definable parameter/value. This manual shows (
Descriptions of the commands are shown with no parameters (?) or (?/=)ith ? or = or both
Commands may be concatenated by entering a semicolon delimiter for example “CFG3=2;FSUM”
Commands are not case sensitive.
To read multiple parameters, a suffix wild card may be used, for example: “CFG*?”.
When writing new values with the CFGn and PNUMSn commands, multiple parameters may be
entered by concatenation using a comma separator.
Example 1: CFG1=3,2=1,5=1
Example 2: PNUM0=+448700762666,11=+44712345678
Example 3: CFG1=3,2=1,5=1;PNUM0=+448700762666
Commands via USB interface (install USB driver before connecting):
The command line must start with AT!
Example 1: “AT!cfg3=2<cr>” (<cr> carriage return/enter)
Example 2: “AT!CFG3=2;Fsum<cr>”
Note: Echo “E” and command response ”Q” (OK/ERROR) behave differently when the terminal is in
charge only mode or active.
In charge only mode, echo and response is turned on with ATE1Q0 or off with ATE0Q1, the default
is on. When the terminal is active, “E” and “Q” comply with normal ETSI standards.
Commands sent by SMS
The first 4 characters must be the terminal PIN (default is 1234). This is then followed by the
command(s).
© 2018 Burnside Telecom Ltd.
Page 8 of 31
Rev 2.3
Example 1: “1234 cfg3=2”
Example 2: “1234 cfg3=2;cfg4=1”
If one or more space characters are used after the PIN, they will be ignored.
All commands that do not implicitly require a response are automatically replied to with a summary of
the terminal status. This automatic reply may be suppressed by placing a stop character after the pin
number. For example 1234. cfg3=2 will change the configuration without replying. An error in the
command will always result in a reply. The reply is either sent to the number that sent the command
or if a colon is used after the PIN, the reply will be sent to the number specified by PNUM11. For
example 1234: cfg3=2.
If the colon is used and PNUM11 is not programmed, no reply will be sent.

Installing USB driver and connecting to a PC
Before connecting the terminal to a computer, please download the appropriate driver from the
Silicon Labs web site. Silicon Labs are the manufacturer of the USB communications device used in
the TX2/TX2L terminals.
http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx
Once the driver has been installed, connect the TX2 to the computer. The computer will also have to
supply power for the terminal.
If it is not convenient to have the computer permanently powering the terminal, it may be possible to
use a “Power booster cable” where the power to the terminal is supplied from the standard Burnside
USB charger. Such cables can be located on the internet. Burnside cannot vouch for the quality of
such cables or be held responsible for any damage cause by using such cables. Another alternative
is to use a powered hub. If in doubt, consult with an IT expert who specialises in hardware.
When the TX2 is connected to the PC, a virtual communications port will be created. This port should
be operated at 115200bps, no parity and one stop bit. No other baud rate can be accepted.
The command interface on the TX terminal complies with ETSI standards which enables a wide
range of communication software to work with the terminals.
If the TX2 is going to be used as an SMS gateway, it is necessary to turn off the SMS command
capability by entering *811*0#.
To allow software that dials a modem for initiating a call via a TAPI interface, the TAPI compatibility
mode should be enabled by entering *813*1#.

Operating tips
Use with Telecare terminals or other automatic dial equipment.
When using equipment that dials into call monitoring centres with signalling equipment, mute the
DTMF tones while the call is being established (CFG31=1 / *844*1#). This will prevent the dialling
terminal from being confused by the dialling tones made by the TX2L.
Phone used in an unattended location or for public use
When providing a courtesy phone or similar, we recommend restricting the call duration to avoid an
excessive call cost or blocked destination if the caller does not hang up the phone. See CFG6=n /
*87*[limit]#.
Using a phone located in a location with a weak mobile signal
Locate the terminal in a location where there is an acceptable level of mobile signal then connect a
longer extension cable to the telephone. For example the TX2 could be in an upper floor near a
window and the phone could be in a ground floor lobby. Increasing the length of the antenna lead to
the terminal is less desirable as some of the signal is lost in the cable, whereas a long phone
extension cable will not impair the performance.
Working with 3G SIMs and the pros & cons of 3G
There is a misconception that a modern SIM requires to work in a terminal that supports the 3G
network. In fact most SIMs that support 3G will also work in 2G. The primary advantage of 3G is high
speed data, but the signal strength of the 3G signal is weaker (1/8th) so the coverage can be sparse
apart from urban areas. For a voice application, 2G works well and in many cases is more suitable.
Regular change of settings
Program a memory key of your phone with a configuration code to change a setting.
For example one memory key may have stored *847*1# to turn on PSTN call forwarding and another
*847*0# to turn off PSTN call forwarding.
Call forwarding:
Confusion often arises between call forwarding and call diversion. The use of the term forward by
mobile network industry refers to a function that diverts calls in the network to a different destination.
Many landline service providers also provide such services and they are sometimes called call
forwarding or call diverting. The TX2L terminal can forward on a call received on the landline to a
destination programmed in the terminal. When this happens, the call on the landline is terminated in
the TX2L and a new call is made from the TX2L via the mobile network.
Caller ID on forwarded calls
When a landline call is forwarded via the TX2L, the caller ID if provided is not forwarded to
destination phone. This is because the landline call is terminated in the TX2L and a new mobile call is
made using the SIM. It is the mobile number assigned to the SIM that will be shown on the receiving
phone.

Troubleshooting
If the amber light is indicating a fault, this may be caused by the following:
• There is no SIM installed.
Remedy: Turn off the unit and install a SIM. Then turn the unit back on.
• There is no battery installed and/or connected.
Remedy: Remove the power, install and connect the battery. Restore power.
• The unit has overheated.
Remedy: Locate the terminal in a cooler location. In particular keep out of direct sunlight.
• Low signal indication or continuous searching indication (see page 14).
Remedy, either locate the terminal in a more suitable position to achieve a stronger signal or use an
antenna with high gain or more suitable location connected via a cable. Losses in a long antenna
cable may cancel out any benefits of a better antenna, so it is often preferable to locate the terminal
in a more suitable location and extend the telephone cable.

Important safety information
Battery
Do not use any other battery other than the one supplied with your terminal.
Power supply
Do not use any other power supply other than the one supplied with your terminal.
Failure to use either the supplied battery or charger can damage the terminal and will invalidate the
warranty.
Operating environment
Make sure that no special regulations are in force that impose restrictions on the use of mobiles.
Restrictions to mobiles would also apply to the terminal.
Electronic devices
Most modern electronic equipment is shielded from radio frequency (RF) signals. However, certain
electronic equipment may not be shielded against the RF signals from your terminal.
Pacemakers
Pacemaker manufacturers recommend that a minimum separation of 20 cm (8 inches) be maintained
between a hand-held wireless phone and a pacemaker. The same restriction should apply to the
antenna of the terminal. If you have any reason to suspect that interference is taking place, switch off
the terminal immediately.
Hearing aids
Some digital wireless phones may interfere with some hearing aids. In the event of such interference,
you may want to consult your service provider.
Other medical devices
Operation of any radio transmitting equipment, including cellular phones, may interfere with the
functionality of inadequately protected medical devices. Consult a physician or the manufacturer of the
medical device to determine if they are adequately shielded from external RF energy or if you have any
questions.
Switch off your terminal in health care facilities when any regulations posted in these areas instruct you
to do so. Hospitals or health care facilities may be using equipment that could be sensitive to external
RF energy.
Vehicles
RF signals may affect improperly installed or inadequately shielded electronic systems in motor
vehicles (e.g. electronic fuel injection systems, electronic anti-skid (anti-lock) braking systems,
electronic speed control systems, air bag systems).
Check with the manufacturer or its representative regarding your vehicle. You should also consult the
manufacturer of any equipment that has been added to your vehicle.
Potentially explosive atmospheres
Do not install the terminal or site the antenna in any area with a potentially explosive atmosphere and
obey all signs and instructions.
Areas with a potentially explosive atmosphere are often but not always clearly marked. They include
below deck on boats; chemical transfer or storage facilities; vehicles using liquefied petroleum gas
(such as propane or butane); areas where the air contains chemicals or particles, such as grain, dust or
metal powders.
Emergency calls
Important! This terminal, like any wireless phone, operates using radio signals, wireless and landline
networks, as well as user-programmed functions, which cannot guarantee connection in all conditions.

Page 26 of 31
Rev 2.3
Therefore, you should never rely solely upon any wireless device for essential communications (e.g.
medical emergencies). Remember, to make or receive any calls, your terminal must be switched on
and in a service area with adequate cellular signal strength. Emergency calls may not be possible on
all wireless phone networks or when certain network services and/or phone features are in use. Check
with local cellular service providers.
